# lift-tracker
This project aims to quantify exertion of muscles used in powerlifting.

## Metrics ##
The following metrics are tracked by this project:

* Maximum force (MF)
* Time under tension (TUT)
* Rate of Force Development (RFD)
* Range of Motion (RM)
* and possibly more...

## Hardware platform ##
In this project the Arduino platform will be used.

## Software platforms ##
The Arduino is programmed with the Arduino IDE, while Processing is used to present the results visually.

### Lead Developer ###
