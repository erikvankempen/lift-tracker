# lift-tracker
This project aims to quantify exertion of muscles used in powerlifting.

## Metrics ##
The following metrics are tracked by this project:

* Maximum force (MF)
* Time under tension (TUT)
* Rate of Force Development (RFD)
* Range of Motion (RM)
* and possibly more...

## Hardware platform ##
In this project the Arduino platform will be used.

## Software platforms ##
The Arduino is programmed with the Arduino IDE, while Processing is used to present the results visually.

### Lead Developer ###

I am [Erik van Kempen](http://nl.linkedin.com/in/evankempen), a lecturer in Statistics, ERP and Business Intelligence at Fontys Univerity of Applied Sciences in Eindhoven, The Netherlands. Prior to my lectureship, I obtained a Bachelor of Business Administration in Accountancy.
